[Verse 1]
          G        Em
I found a love for me
              C                            
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my 
D
lead
                G          Em
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        C                                 
I never knew you were the someone waiting 
    D
for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                                G
Cause we were just kids when we fell in 
love
            Em                      C    
Not knowing what it was, I will not give 
            G  D
you up this ti-ime
             G                           
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is 
Em
all I own
            C                     D
And in your eyes you're holding mine
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C             G          D   
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you 
           Em
between my arms
C                G     D                
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our 
Em
favourite song
          C                G       
When you said you looked a mess, I 
          D              Em
whispered underneath my breath
         C                G        D       
But you heard it, darling you look perfect 
   G
tonight

[Verse 2]
                G                    Em
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone
 I know
              C                           
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday 
               D
I'll share her home
           G             Em
I found a love, to carry more than just my 
secrets
         C                              D
To carry love, to carry children of our own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                             G           
We are still kids, but we're so in love, 
          Em
fighting against all odds
             C               G  D
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             G                             
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll
 Em
 be your man
         C               D
I see my future in your eyes
 
[Chorus]
      Em   C              G         D   
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you 
           Em
between my arms
C                G     D                
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our 
Em
favourite song
        C                G               
When I saw you in that dress, looking so 
 D
beautiful
  Em       C                  G        
I don't deserve this, darling you look 
D          G
perfect tonight

In person, and she looks perfect
